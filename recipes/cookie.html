    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar :</strong> The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar. 

            1 ½ cups white sugar
            </li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.

            1 cup butter, softened
            </li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.

            2 eggs
             </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies.

            2 teaspoons vanilla extract
            </li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.

            2 cups all-purpose flour
            </li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!

            ⅔ cup cocoa powder
            </li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.

            ¾ teaspoon baking soda
             </li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.

            ¼ teaspoon salt
             </li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.

            2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
             </li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts (optional):</strong> Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. 

            ½ cup chopped walnuts (Optional)
            </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in another bowl; stir into butter mixture until well blended. Mix in chocolate chips and walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven just until set, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool slightly on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely. </li>
    
    </ol>
