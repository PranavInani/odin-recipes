    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stir together warm water, yeast, and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl; let sit for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in 2 1/2 cups flour until incorporated. Turn dough out onto a clean, floured surface. Knead dough, adding remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough is no longer sticky. Place dough into an oiled bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li> Punch down dough and form it into a tight ball. Allow dough to relax for 1 minute before rolling out. </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li> If baking dough on a pizza stone, place toppings on dough and bake immediately. If baking dough on a pan, lightly oil the pan and let dough rise for 15 to 20 minutes before topping and baking it. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    </ul>
